### http-server
http-server is a simple, zero-configuration command-line http server. It is powerful enough for production usage, but it's simple and hackable enough to be used for testing, local development, and learning.
https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server

Installation via npm:
`npm install http-server -g`
This will install http-server globally so that it may be run from the command line.

Usage:
 `http-server [path] [options]`
[path] defaults to ./public if the folder exists, and ./ otherwise.
